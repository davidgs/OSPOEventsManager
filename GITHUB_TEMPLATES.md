3. Select the appropriate template
4. Fill in all sections (especially required ones)
5. Add any relevant labels, assignees, or milestones
6. Submit the issue

### Template Customization

To customize templates for your needs:

1. Edit files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. Update `config.yml` with your URLs and contacts
3. Modify sections to match your workflow
4. Test by creating a new issue

## Integration with Documentation

The templates reference the in-app documentation system:
- Links to `/docs` pages in the application
- References to FAQ and troubleshooting guides
- Encourages checking documentation before reporting

## Best Practices Enforced

1. **Search Before Creating**: Templates remind users to search for existing issues
2. **Complete Information**: Required fields ensure actionable reports
3. **Environment Details**: Captured systematically for debugging
4. **Reproducible Steps**: Bug reports require step-by-step reproduction
5. **Impact Assessment**: Feature requests include priority and benefits
6. **Security First**: Critical vulnerabilities handled privately

## Label System

Templates automatically suggest labels:
- **Type**: bug, enhancement, documentation, security, deployment, question
- **Priority**: critical, high, medium, low
- **Status**: confirmed, investigating, in-progress, blocked
- **Component**: frontend, backend, database, auth

## Issue Lifecycle

```
New → Triage → Confirmed → In Progress → Review → Testing → Done
                                                           ↓
                                                      Wontfix/Duplicate
```

## Benefits

✅ **Faster Triage**: Consistent format speeds up review
✅ **Better Information**: Required fields ensure completeness
✅ **Improved Collaboration**: Clear structure helps contributors
✅ **Professional Process**: Shows project maturity
✅ **Security Awareness**: Proper handling of security issues
✅ **Documentation Integration**: Links to project docs
✅ **User-Friendly**: Clear guidance for all user types

## Next Steps

1. **Update config.yml**: Replace placeholder URLs with actual links
2. **Configure Labels**: Set up label system in GitHub repository
3. **Train Team**: Share ISSUE_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md with contributors
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track which templates are most used
5. **Iterate**: Improve templates based on feedback

## Examples
