System Goal: To replace the spreadsheet-based events list with a robust, trackable system for OSPO AI Community Architects, using a containerized approach with Express/TypeScript for the backend.

Revised Implementation Plan:
Technology Stack Selection:
Database: Use PostgreSQL or MySQL. Can be containerized, or initially managed separately.
Backend: Develop the backend API using Express with TypeScript. Packaged in a Docker container.
Frontend: Build the user interface using a frontend framework like React, Vue, or Angular. Packaged in a Docker container.
Identity Provider: Implement Keycloak or similar, which can also be containerized.
Database Design:
Tables:
`events`: Event name, link, start/end dates, location, priority, goal/type.
`cfp_submissions`: Event ID, submitter, abstract.
`attendees`: Event ID, attendee details.
`sponsorship`: Sponsorship details.
Add fields for all mandatory and optional requirements from the PRD.
Backend API Development (Express + TypeScript):
Environment Setup: Initialize a Node.js project with TypeScript and Express.
Data Models: Define TypeScript interfaces for the database entities (events, CFPs, attendees, etc.).
Database Interaction: Implement data access logic using an ORM or database library suitable for TypeScript (e.g., TypeORM, Prisma, or just pg/mysql2 with type definitions).
API Endpoints: Develop RESTful API endpoints using Express:
CRUD operations for events, CFPs, attendees, and sponsorship.
Endpoints for filtered views, calendar data, etc.
Middleware: Implement middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling.
Containerization: Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the Express + TypeScript backend application.
Frontend Development:
Technology: Choose a frontend framework like React, Vue, or Angular.
Development: Build the user interface with:
Event List, Event Detail View, Forms for data entry.
Views: Filtered, Map/location, Calendar, etc.
User Authentication integration with Keycloak.
Containerization: Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the frontend application.
Notifications:
Implementation: Use a task queue or a scheduling library in the backend (e.g., node-schedule or Bull) to handle asynchronous tasks:
3-day reminders for CFP deadlines.
Notifications for proposal status updates.
Notifications for newly added CFPs (digest option).
This logic can be integrated within the Express backend or in a separate container if needed.
Asset Collection:
Implementation: Provide an interface to upload and manage assets:
Abstracts, Bios, Headshots, Trip reports.
Storage: Use a cloud storage service (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage), or a self-hosted solution like MinIO (which can be containerized). Store asset metadata (links) in the database.
Containerization Strategy:
Docker: Use Docker to containerize the backend API (Express + TypeScript), the frontend application, and any other necessary services (Keycloak, database).
Docker Compose: Use Docker Compose for local development and testing.
Specific Features:
Mandatory Requirements: Primary fields in the data model, always captured.
Optional Requirements: Optional fields in forms, displayed accordingly.
User Experience: Develop intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
Incorporating PRD Sections:
Stakeholders/Reviewers: Sections to manage stakeholders and reviewers with statuses and approval dates. Allow adding via comments or direct entry.
Dependencies: Implement the table for local and external dependencies.
Use Cases/Definitions: Create sections to manage use cases and definitions.
Testing and Documentation:
Testing: Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha with TypeScript.
Documentation: Update all relevant documentation (user guides, API documentation, Dockerfile instructions, type definitions, etc.).
Deployment (Initially):
Use Docker Compose to run the containers locally for development.
Allows for a smooth development workflow and easy testing before a full production deployment.
Advantages of Express with TypeScript for Backend:
Strong Typing: TypeScript's static typing improves code quality, maintainability, and reduces runtime errors.
Improved Developer Experience: Better autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring support.
Scalability: Express is a lightweight and fast Node.js framework suitable for building scalable APIs.
This focused plan on using Express with TypeScript ensures a robust and maintainable backend, along with the overall benefits of containerization and future readiness for platforms like OpenShift.
