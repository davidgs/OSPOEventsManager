# OSPO Application Deployment Guide

## Current Status

Your OSPO Event Management application is configured and ready to deploy. You have two deployment options:

### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Current Environment)
- ✅ Application is running on port 5000
- ✅ Connected to Neon PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Database schema initialized with sample data
- ⚠️ Keycloak authentication needs external setup

### Option 2: Docker Compose Deployment (Local/Server Environment)
- ✅ Complete docker-compose.yml configuration ready
- ✅ PostgreSQL, Keycloak, Application, and Nginx proxy configured
- ✅ All services properly networked and dependent
- ✅ Health checks and startup scripts included

## To Deploy with Docker Compose (on a Docker-capable system):

1. **Copy all files to your target system:**
   ```bash
   # Copy these files:
   - docker-compose.yml
   - docker-compose.override.yml
   - nginx.conf
   - keycloak-realm-export.json
   - .env.docker
   - start-docker.sh
   - Dockerfile
   - init-db.sql
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x start-docker.sh
   ./start-docker.sh
   ```

3. **Access points:**
   - Application: http://localhost
   - Keycloak Admin: http://localhost:8080/auth/admin
   - Database Admin: http://localhost:5050

## Current Replit Setup

Your application is running with:
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (external, persistent)
- **Authentication:** Keycloak proxy configuration (needs external Keycloak)
- **Application:** Full OSPO event management features

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate use:** Continue using the Replit environment for development
2. **For production:** Deploy using the Docker Compose setup on a server
3. **For authentication:** Set up external Keycloak or modify to use Replit Auth

The Docker Compose configuration provides a complete, self-contained deployment with all services properly configured and networked.
