  - Proper error handling with type guards
  - Fixed CSV column mapping type assertions
  - Resolved Vite import issues with TypeScript ignore comments
  - Fixed Node.js compatibility issues with `__dirname` vs `import.meta.dirname`

### Known Issues
- Users page currently shows only 1 user (David Simmons) - may need additional user seeding
- Some Keycloak integration features may need further testing
- File upload size limits and type restrictions may need adjustment based on usage

### Next Steps
- **Documentation Expansion**
  - Complete user documentation: CFP submissions, file uploads, user profile, approval workflows
  - Create admin documentation: user management, event review, system settings, backup/restore procedures
  - Develop developer documentation: API endpoints, database schema details, local setup, configuration guide, security practices
  - Add general documentation: system requirements, complete changelog, comprehensive troubleshooting
- Add more comprehensive user management features
- Implement bulk operations for events and assets
- Add advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Enhance reporting and analytics features
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add automated testing suite
- **MinIO Integration**: Currently not in use - decide to either implement fully or remove
  - Application uses direct PVC storage at `/app/uploads` (10Gi)
  - MinIO deployment exists but is not integrated into application code
  - Options: (1) Implement S3-compatible MinIO storage, or (2) Remove unused MinIO components
- **Keycloak Custom Domain Route**
  - Create OpenShift route for `keycloak-prod.rh-events.org` with Let's Encrypt certificate
  - Run created script: `create-keycloak-prod-route.sh` (if still exists)
  - Verify DNS configuration points to OpenShift router
