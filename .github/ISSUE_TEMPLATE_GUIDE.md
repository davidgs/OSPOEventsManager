2. **Use the right template**: Choose the most appropriate template
3. **Be specific**: Provide detailed, actionable information
4. **Include context**: Help others understand the problem
5. **One issue per report**: Don't combine multiple unrelated issues

7. **Update status**: Comment if you find a workaround or solution

### For Maintainers

1. **Triage promptly**: Review new issues within 48 hours
2. **Label appropriately**: Add relevant labels (bug, enhancement, etc.)
3. **Set priority**: Use priority labels (critical, high, medium, low)
4. **Assign milestone**: Add to appropriate milestone if applicable
5. **Request info**: Ask for missing details politely
6. **Close duplicates**: Link to the original issue
7. **Update status**: Keep the issue updated with progress

## Examples

### Good Bug Report
```markdown
**Title**: [BUG] Event creation fails with 500 error when CFP deadline is empty

**Environment**:
- Deployment: Prod
- Browser: Chrome 120
- Role: User

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Click "New Event"
2. Fill in required fields
3. Leave CFP deadline empty
4. Click "Create Event"

**Expected**: Event should be created without CFP deadline
**Actual**: 500 error returned
**Error**: `Cannot read property 'toISOString' of null`
```

### Good Feature Request
```markdown
**Title**: [FEATURE] Add bulk export for multiple events

- Used by admins weekly
```
